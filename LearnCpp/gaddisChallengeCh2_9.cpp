/*  Cyborg Data Type Sizes
You have been given a job as a programmer on a Cyborg
supercomputer. In order to accomplish some calculations,
you need to know how many bytes the following data types
use, char, int, float, and double. You do not have any
manuals, so you can't look this information up. Write a
C++ program that will determine the amount of memory
used by these types and display the information on the
screen.
