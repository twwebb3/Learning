/*  Annual Pay
Suppose an employee gets paid every two weeks and earns $1700.00
each pay period. In a year the employee gets paid 26 times. Write
a program that defines the following variables: 

payAmount   This variable will hold the amount of pay the employee
			earns each pay period. Initialize the variable with 1700.0
payPeriods  This variable will hold the number of pay periods in a
			year. Initialize the variable with 26.
annualPay	This variable will hold the employee's total annual pay,
			which will be calculated.

The program should calculate the employee's total annual pay by
multiplying the employee's pay amount by the number of pay periods
in a year, and store the result in the annualPay variable. Display
the total annual pay on the screen.
