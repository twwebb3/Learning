/*  Box Office
A movie theater only keeps a percentage of the revenue
earned from ticket sales. The remainder goes to the
movie distributor. Write a program that calculates a
theater's gross and net box office profit for a night.
The program should ask for the name of the movie, and
how many adult and child tickets were sold. (The price
of an adult ticket is $6.00 and a child's ticket is
$3.00.) It should display a report similar to

Movie Name:					"Wheels of Fury"
Adult Tickets Sold:				382
Child Tickets Sold:				127
Gross Box Office Profit:	$ 2673.00
Net Box Office Profit:		$  534.60
Amount Paid to Distributor:	$ 2138.40
