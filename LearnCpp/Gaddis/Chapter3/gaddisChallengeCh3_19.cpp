/*  How Many Pizzas?
Modify the program you wrote in Programming Challenge 18 (Pizza Pi) so that it
reports the number of pizzas you need to buy for a party if each person attending is
expected to eat an average of four slices. The program should ask the user for the
number of people who will be at the party and for the diameter of the pizzas to be
ordered. It should then calculate and display the number of pizzas to purchase.
