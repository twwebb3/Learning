/*  Ocean Levels
Assuming the ocean's level is currently rising at about 1.5mm
per year, write a program that displays:

- The number of mm higher than the current level that the
  ocean's level will be in 5 years
- The number of mm higher than the current level that the
  ocean's level will be in 7 years
- The number of mm higher than the current level that the
  ocean's level will be in 10 years
