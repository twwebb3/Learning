/*  Distance per Tank of Gas
A car with a 20-gallon gas tank averages 21.5 miles per gallon
when driven in town and 26.8 MPG when driven on the highway.
Write a program that calculates and displays the distance the
car can travel on one tank of gas when driven in town and when
driven on the highway.

Hint: The following formula can be used to calculate the distance:
Distance = Number of Gallons X Average MPG
