/*  Average of Values
To get the average of a series of values, you add the values up
and then divide by the sum by the number of values. Write a
program that stores the following values in five different
variables: 28, 32, 37, 24, and 33. The program should first
calculate the sum of these five varibles and store the result in
a second varable named sum. Then, the program should divide the
sum variable by 5 to get the average. Display the average on the screen.
