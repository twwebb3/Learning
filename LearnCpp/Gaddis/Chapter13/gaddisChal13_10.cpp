/*  Population
In a population, the birth rate and death rate are calculated as follows:
Birth Rate = Number of Births รท Population 
Death Rate = Number of Deaths รท Population
For example, in a population of 100,000 that has 8,000 births and 6,000 deaths per 
year, the birth rate and death rate are:
Birth Rate = 8,000 รท 100,000 = 0.08
Death Rate = 6,000 รท 100,000 = 0.06
Design a Population class that stores a population, number of births, and number of 
deaths for a period of time. Member functions should return the birth rate and death 
rate. Implement the class in a program.
Input Validation: Do not accept population figures less than 1, or birth or death 
numbers less than 0.
